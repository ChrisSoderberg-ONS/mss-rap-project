# Abalone Age Prediction Project

## Description

This project aims to predict the age of abalone based on various physical measurements. The analysis involves loading and cleaning data, preprocessing, feature engineering, training a model, and evaluating its performance. The project is modularized into different scripts for better maintainability and readability.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following modules:

data_loading.py: Contains functions for loading the dataset.
data_preprocessing.py: Contains functions for preprocessing the dataset, including mapping categorical variables and splitting the data.
model.py: Contains functions for training the model and evaluating predictions.
plotting.py: Contains functions for plotting data visualizations.
main.py: The main script that orchestrates the entire pipeline.

## How to Use the Code

### Prerequisites:

Python 3.x
Required libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, ucimlrepo
You can install the required libraries using pip:
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn ucimlrepo

### Instructions:

1. Clone the repository (or download the project files):
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <project-directory>
2. Run the main script:
    python main.py
This script will execute the entire data analysis pipeline, including data loading, preprocessing, plotting visualizations, model training, and evaluation. The evaluation metrics will be printed to the console.

## Government Guidance on Project Documentation

To ensure the project adheres to government guidelines for reproducibility and transparency, the following best practices are followed:

1. Clear Documentation: Provide a comprehensive README file that describes the project, its structure, and usage instructions.
2. Modular Code: Organize the code into modules based on functionality to improve readability and maintainability.
3. Version Control: Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes and collaborate effectively.
4. Testing: Include tests for critical parts of the code to ensure correctness.
5. Metadata: Include metadata for datasets and document any data transformations performed.
6. Reproducibility: Ensure that the analysis can be reproduced by providing all necessary code, data, and instructions.
